The assembler is written in Coco, and must first be compiled to
Javascript to be run directly. To do so:

1. Install node.js
2. Install npm
3. run `npm install --global coco`
   this installs the 'coco' and 'coke' command-line tools
4. run `coke build`

The resulting 'assembler.js' file that is created in the directory
can then be run with the statements in 'RUN'.
